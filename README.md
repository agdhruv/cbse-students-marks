# cbse-students-marks

This script can be used to find out the 2017 CBSE Grade 12 scores (scores and grades of all subjects, and total percentage) of all students of a school.
The pre-requisites are that you must know the school code, examination centre code, and roll number of any one student. This is not a fool-proof method, but was a great Python exercise.

You will need to install `requests` and `bs4` (Beautiful Soup 4) to run this script.
